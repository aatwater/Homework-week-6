## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

### I know this is way too late but I found the linear regression stuff very useful for my data replication project ###


### [1] Write a simple R function, Z.prop.test(), that can perform one- or two-sample Z-tests for proportion data, using the following guidelines.

### Your function should take the following arguments: p1 and n1 (no default) representing the estimated proportion and sample size (i.e., based on your sample data); p2 and n2 (both defaulting to NULL) that contain a second sample's proportion and sample size data in the event of a two-sample test; p0 (no default) as the expected value for the population proportion; and alternative (default "two.sided") and conf.level (default 0.95), to be used in the same way as in the function t.test().
### When conducting a two-sample test, it should be p1 that is tested as being smaller or larger than p2 when alternative="less" or alternative="greater", the same as in the use of x and y in the function t.test().
###The function should perform a one-sample Z-test using p1, n1, and p0 if either p2 or n2 (or both) is NULL.
###The function should contain a check for the rules of thumb we have talked about ($n * p > 5$ and $n * (1-p) > 5$) to ensure the validity of assuming the normal distribution in both the one- and two-sample settings. If this is violated, the function should still complete but it should also print an appropriate warning message.
### The function should return a list containing the members Z (the test statistic), P (the appropriate p value), and CI (the two-sided CI with respect to "conf.level" around p1 in the case of a one-sample test and around p2-p1 in the case of a two-sample test). For all test alternatives ("two.sided", "greater", "less"), calculate symmetric CIs based on quantiles of the normal distribution rather than worrying about calculating single-limit confidence bounds.



### Two: The dataset from Kamilar and Cooper has in it a large number of variables related to life history and body size. For this exercise, the end aim is to fit a simple linear regression model to predict longevity ("MaxLongevity_m") measured in months from species' brain size ("Brain_Size_Species_Mean") measured in grams. Do the following for both longevity~brain size and log(longevity)~log(brain size).

library (ggplot2)
library (curl)

### Fit the regression model and, using {ggplot2}, produce a scatterplot with the fitted line superimposed upon the data. Append the the fitted model equation to your plot (HINT: use the function geom_text()).

hiii <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ADA2016/master/KamilarAndCooperData.csv")
brains <- read.csv(hiii, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

k <-ggplot(brains, aes(x=Brain_Size_Species_Mean, y=MaxLongevity_m)) + geom_point(shape=0) + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)
k
lm_eqn = function(k) { 

l <- list(a = format(coef(k)[1], digits = 2), b = format(abs(coef(k)[2]), digits = 2), r2 = format(summary(k)$r.squared, digits = 3)); if (coef(k)[2] >= 0)  { eq <- substitute(italic(y) == a + b %.% italic(x)*","~~italic(r)^2~"="~r2,l) } else {eq <-substitute(italic(y) == a - b %.% italic(x)*","~~italic(r)^2~"="~r2,l)   }as.character(as.expression(eq));}


kplot <- k + geom_text(aes(x = 400, y = 250, label = lm_eqn(lm(MaxLongevity_m ~ Brain_Size_Species_Mean))), parse = TRUE)

kplot

logk <- ggplot(brains, aes(x=log(Brain_Size_Species_Mean), y=log(MaxLongevity_m))) + geom_point(shape=0) +
    geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)

logk
logk2<-logk+geom_text(aes(x = 5, y = 5, label = lm_eqn(lm(MaxLongevity_m ~ Brain_Size_Species_Mean))), parse = TRUE)
logk2

### Identify and interpret the point estimate of the slope ($\beta_1$), as well as the outcome of the test associated with the hypotheses H0: $\beta_1$ = 0; HA: $\beta_1$ â‰  0. Also, find a 90 percent CI for the slope ($\beta_1$) parameter.

hi <- lm(MaxLongevity_m ~ Brain_Size_Species_Mean , data = brains)
hi
summary(hi)

hilog<-lm(log(MaxLongevity_m)~log(Brain_Size_Species_Mean), data=brains)
hilog
summary(hilog)

derp = data.frame(Brain_Size_Species_Mean=248.95)
slurp<-predict(hi, derp, interval="confidence", level=0.90)
slurp

### Using your model, add lines for the 90 percent confidence and prediction interval bands on the plot and add a legend to differentiate between the lines.



### Produce a point estimate and associated 90 percent PI for the longevity of a species whose brain weight is 800 gm. Do you trust the model to predict observations accurately for this value of the explanatory variable? Why or why not?


### Looking at your two models, which do you think is better? Why?
